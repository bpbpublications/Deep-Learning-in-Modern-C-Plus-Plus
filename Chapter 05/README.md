## Instructions to build & run the experiments

### Pre-requisites

The following packages are required:

- Eigen: the core C++ linear algebra library, extensively used over the text

### Building the code

The experiments can be built by the following commands
```
chapter_5 $ mkdir build
chapter_5 $ cd build
chapter_5/build $ cmake ..
chapter_5/build $ make
```

### Running the experiments

The first experiment can be executed by

```
chapter_5/build $ ./activation_example
```

The second experiment can be executed by

```
chapter_5/build $ ./FC_layer_func
```

The third experiment can be executed by

```
chapter_5/build $ ./mlp_example
```

The Flatten experiment can be executed by
